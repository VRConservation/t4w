abstract: |
  This chapter provides an introduction to technology for wildlife conservation. We explore the intersection of modern technology and wildlife conservation efforts, establishing the foundation for understanding how innovative tools and approaches can support conservation goals. The chapter also overviews the book's purpose, audience, and chapters.

# Tech4wildlife
Watch just about nature documentary from the past five decades and you will see technology on display to track, monitor and capture wildlife and nature for all to see. Recent BBC episodes with David Attenborough also feature behind the scenes work to find wildlife and film them during intimate moments or epic displays of migration and landscapes. Tech, for better or worse, has infiltrated our entire lives from tracking steps, to our own human movements. So why not use it for good to protect species, their habitats, and the planet, that are all threatened by over consumption, poaching, wildfire, land clearing for agriculture, and ulimately climate change, all human induced?

We believe it should be, but most recently rewilding (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.12.003 and https://doi.org/10.4103/cs.cs_19_14) and wilderness (@nash, @woods) proponents before them make the case that nature should be an autonomous, self-willed systems free from anything created by humankind. Self regulating community (@soule).

Pettorelli making rewilding fit for policy also mentions self-regulating system dynamics ( https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13082)

As @wich mention in their seminal Conservation Technology book, the Anthropocene, and accompanying digital age, represent an extreme threat and wondeful opportunity to the conservation of wild nature.


## Interoperability & IoT
Integration of hardware and software

Setting up mesh networks and internet of things is critical over a conservation landscape

## Data

## Scaling

## Rewilding
Or make this a caveats section. Truly rewilded self-willed wilderness should not have tech. Also caveats on the use of surveillance, top-down enforceent, and the availability of tech in developing countries.
